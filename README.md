# emailerizer
Sends personalized email to multiple contacts via Gmail.

Instructions:

1) Edit the file "contacts.csv" so that it contains the first names and emails of those you would like to send to. The first name and the email should be seperated by comma and each contact should be on on its own line.

2) Edit the file "email_body.txt" and place your message AFTER the comma that is at the beginning of the file. The program will combine the contact's name with your message so that it looks like this when sent: Hello [CUSTOM_NAME], [THE_BODY_OF_YOUR_MESSAGE_WILL_BE_HERE]

3) Edit the file "emailerizer.py". Where indicated (near the top of the file), place your email address, your Gmail app password, and the subject of the email.

4) Run the file "emailerizer.py". The emails will be sent. All done!
